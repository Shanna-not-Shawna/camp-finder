## Description

The purpose of this project is to build an application that allows users to enter a state and generate a list of national parks. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and third-party CSS framework powered by JavaScript.

## Usage

To search for a campground, choose a state from the drop down and click on Search. This will display every national park in the chosen state. To refine results further, a user can select a specific park and a specific campsite within that park. Previous searches will be saved so the user can revisit previous searches.

Here is the live website. [Try it out!](https://shanna-not-shawna.github.io/camp-finder/) <br/>
